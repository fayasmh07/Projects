This Writeup contains the practical work done as a part of **Google Professional Cyber Security Course**.

## Scenario
In this scenario, you’re a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You’ll be required to configure **Suricata** and use it to trigger alerts.
Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you'll explore custom rules in Suricata. Second, you'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the `fast.log` file. Finally, you’ll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard eve.json log file.

For the purposes of the tests you’ll run in this lab activity, you’ve been supplied with a `sample.pcap` file and a `custom.rules` file. These reside in your home folder.
Let’s define the files you’ll be working with in this lab activity:

The `sample.pcap` file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which you’ll use to test the Suricata rules. This will allow you to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.

The `custom.rules` file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. You’ll add rules to this file and run them against the network traffic data in the `sample.pcap` file.

The `fast.log` file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The `fast.log` file is empty when the lab starts. Each time you test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the fast.log file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The `fast.log` file can be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory after Suricata runs.The `fast.log` file is considered to be a depreciated format and is not recommended for incident response or threat hunting tasks but can be used to perform quick checks or tasks related to quality assurance.

The `eve.json` file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in `JSON` format. The `eve.json` file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory.

When you create a new rule, you'll need to test the rule to confirm whether or not it worked as expected. You can use the fast.log file to quickly compare the number of alerts generated each time you run Suricata to test a signature against the `sample.pcap` file.


# Task 1. Examine a custom rule in Suricata

1. Use the cat command to display the rule in the `custom.rules` file:

`cat custom.rules`

### Action
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc55af80-1314-4603-a3c9-fb60e764fb54)

The **action** is the first part of the signature. It determines the action to take if all conditions are met. Actions differ across network intrusion detection system (NIDS) rule languages, but some common actions are alert, drop, pass, and reject.
Using our example, the file contains a single `alert` as the action. The alert keyword instructs to alert on selected network traffic. The IDS will inspect the traffic packets and send out an alert in case it matches.

*Note that the `drop` action also generates an `alert`, but it drops the traffic. A `drop` action only occurs when Suricata runs in IPS mode.*

The `pass` action allows the traffic to pass through the network interface. The `pass` rule can be used to override other rules. An exception to a `drop` rule can be made with a pass rule. For example, the following rule has an identical signature to the previous example, except that it singles out a specific IP address to allow only traffic from that address to pass:

```
pass http 172.17.0.77 any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"BAD USER-AGENT";flow:established,to_server;content:!”Mozilla/5.0”; http_user_agent; sid: 12365; rev:1;)
```
The `reject` action does not allow the traffic to pass. Instead, a TCP reset packet will be sent, and Suricata will drop the matching packet. A TCP reset packet tells computers to stop sending messages to each other.

### Header
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf809f8d-02ab-4884-9589-819a31211787)

The next part of the signature is the **header**. The header defines the signature’s network traffic, which includes attributes such as protocols, source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and traffic direction.
The next field after the action keyword is the **protocol** field. In our example, the protocol is `http`, which determines that the rule applies only to HTTP traffic.
The parameters to the protocol http field are `$HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any`. The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic coming from the `$HOME_NET` and going to the destination IP address `$EXTERNAL_NET`.
`$HOME_NET` is a Suricata variable defined in /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml that you can use in your rule definitions as a placeholder for your local or home network to identify traffic that connects to or from systems within your organization.

In this lab `$HOME_NET` is defined as the `172.21.224.0/20` subnet.
The word `any` means that Suricata catches traffic from any port defined in the `$HOME_NET` network.

### Rule Options
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4db212f9-ffce-4cd6-a7a4-2946a3bf69b6)

The many available **rule options** allow you to customize signatures with additional parameters. Configuring rule options helps narrow down network traffic so you can find exactly what you’re looking for. As in our example, rule options are typically enclosed in a pair of parentheses and separated by semicolons.

Let's further examine the rule options in our example:

- The `msg` :  option provides the alert text. In this case, the alert will print out the text “GET on wire”, which specifies why the alert was triggered.
- The `flow` : established,to_server option determines that packets from the client to the server should be matched. (In this instance, a server is defined as the device responding to the initial SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet.)
- The `content` : `"GET"` option tells Suricata to look for the word GET in the content of the http.method portion of the packet.
- The `sid:12345` (signature ID) option is a unique numerical value that identifies the rule.
- The `rev` : 3 option indicates the signature's revision which is used to identify the signature's version. Here, the revision version is 3.
- To summarize, this signature triggers an alert whenever Suricata observes the text GET as the HTTP method in an HTTP packet from the home network going to the external network.

# Task 2. Trigger a custom rule in Suricata

1. List the files in the /var/log/suricata folder:

`ls -l /var/log/suricata`

2. Run suricata using the custom.rules and sample.pcap files:

`sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none`

This command starts the **Suricata** application and processes the `sample.pcap` file using the rules in the `custom.rules` file. It returns an output stating how many packets were processed by Suricata.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d76820d-220d-482e-a514-96fe81bbf37f)

Now you’ll further examine the options in the command:

- The `-r` `sample.pcap` option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the sample.pcap file.
- The `-S``custom.rules` option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the custom.rules file.
- The `-k` `none` option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.
As a refresher, checksums are a way to detect if a packet has been modified in transit. Because you are using network traffic from a sample packet capture file, you won't need Suricata to check the integrity of the checksum.

Suricata adds a new alert line to the `/var/log/suricata/fast.log` file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met.

3. List the files in the /var/log/suricata folder again:

`ls -l /var/log/suricata`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1488d93e-cf25-4844-8ee6-a4dbbeeda30f)

4. Use the cat command to display the fast.log file generated by Suricata:

`cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/689d987a-eccb-4bda-a8a4-ec37dff02760)

Each line or entry in the fast.log file corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each alert line includes the message that identifies the rule that triggered the alert, as well as the source, destination, and direction of the traffic.

# Task 3. Examine eve.json output

The eve.json file is the standard and main Suricata log file and contains a lot more data than the fast.log file. This data is stored in a JSON format, which makes it much more useful for analysis and processing by other applications.

1. Use the `cat` command to display the entries in the `eve.json` file:

`cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36119e1f-71e1-4c13-b291-ed3b3d39743f)

The output returns the raw content of the file. You'll notice that there is a lot of data returned that is not easy to understand in this format.

2.  Use the `jq` command to display the entries in an improved format:

`jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less`

**OUTPUT :**
```
analyst@fe45f148eaf1:~$ jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less

3. Press **Q** to exit the `less` command and to return to the command-line prompt.

4. Use the `jq` command to extract specific event data from the `eve.json` file:

`jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4d3ce01-73ca-478b-9868-1eccddf8a02f)

5. Use the `jq` command to display all event logs related to a specific `flow_id` from the `eve.json` file. The `flow_id` value is a 16-digit number and will vary for each of the log entries. Replace `X` with any of the `flow_id` values returned by the previous query:

`jq "select(.flow_id==X)" /var/log/suricata/eve.json`

**OUTPUT :**

*Note: A network flow refers to a sequence of packets between a source and destination that share common characteristics such as IP addresses, protocols, and more. In cybersecurity, network traffic flows help analysts understand the behavior of network traffic to identify and analyze threats. Suricata assigns a unique flow_id to each network flow. All logs from a network flow share the same flow_id. This makes the flow_id field a useful field for correlating network traffic that belongs to the same network flows.*
