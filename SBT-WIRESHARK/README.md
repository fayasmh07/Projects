  NETWORK ANALYSIS CHALLENGE
</h1>

This project is done as a part of the **INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK ANALYSIS** Course.
The Activity is as follows:

Alexis is a fictional cybersecurity company with thousands of employees. An attacker has gained unauthorized entry into its premises and has connected their laptop to an unused port on a switch. The attacker now has access to the companyâ€™s internal networks. Within the internal network, there is a central server where critical proprietary data is stored. In this capture, the attacker is attempting to collect SSH credentials that they can use to log into the central server.


1. What is the MAC address of the attacker?
2. What is the type of attack which is taking place that allows the attacker to listen in on conversations between the central server and another host?
3. What is the file which was downloaded from the central server?
4. What department does Borden Danilevich work in?
5. What is the SSH password of the Domain Administrator?
