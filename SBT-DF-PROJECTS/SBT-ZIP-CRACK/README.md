  SBT ZIP CRACK
</h1>

To help get you familiar with fcrackzip, we have created a short quiz consisting of 4 questions. In this activity, you’ll be cracking the passwords of two ZIP files. One using a brute-force attack, and one using a dictionary attack.

BruteForceAttack.zip – You are to brute-force this ZIP file using fcrackzip. Once you have the password, extract the text file FLAG1.txt and enter the text string as your answer for the quiz. For this file, you have been informed that the password is 6 characters long, and contains only lowercase letters, and numbers. (Time to crack approx 5mins 30secs)
DictionaryAttack.zip – You are to brute-force this ZIP file using fcrackzip and the rockyou.txt wordlist. Once you have the password, extract the text file FLAG2.txt and enter the text string as your answer for the quiz. (Time to crack approx 3 mins)
If your attempts are taking significantly longer than the stated approximate times, reconsider the command you are using, and make sure you’re following the brief above. The above times are based on a 2017 MacBook Pro.)
