  SBT STEGNOGRAPHY LAB
</h1>

To help get you familiar with using Steghide, we have created a short quiz consisting of 4 questions. For this activity, you’ll need to download our test environment consisting of directories and files. Download this .ZIP file inside your Kali VM (click the button below, then the download icon in the top right corner) and unzip it using “unzip SBT_Steg_Lab.zip”. Below are the questions you’ll be asked in the quiz, so make sure you have your answers ready.

When working on Questions 2, 3, and 4 you’ll need to attempt to extract embedded files with the passphrase list below. If the file does not have hidden data using that password, it will print an error message as shown in the below screenshot. You should attempt to use each passphrase on each file. Not all files will contain hidden files. Eventually you will have extracted three text files named FLAG1.txt, FLAG2.txt, and FLAG3.txt which will contain the flag values you need to answer these questions correctly.
