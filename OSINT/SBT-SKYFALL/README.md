# SKYFALL - SECURITY BLUETEAM 

Done this *PROJECT* as a part of the *INTRODUCTION TO OSINT*  Course from Security Blue Team.
The task is provided below.

---

You work for a law enforcement organisation, and you have been assigned to track a person-of-interest, that is believed to be associated with a hacking group that recently compromised a Managed Service Provider (MSP) and are trying to sell the stolen credentials on both the clear net and dark web. Another team is focusing on the dark web lead, so you have been tasked with using OSINT sources to build up a profile on the individual and attempt to locate any evidence that links them to the MSP breach and sale of account details. You have been provided with some information to start your investigation. You should use any of the sources or tools taught in this course, that you deem to be applicable and appropriate. We know that the email address used to register the Twitter account is fake, so do not include this in your report.

Your manager has provided you with the following starting information:

Twitter handle used by actor: *@sp1ritfyre*
You can download a list of the information you have been asked to retrieve about the subject (.txt file). You should use this to help you find the right information, ready to hand in during the Challenge Submission in the next lesson. This will help to keep you on track, and not gather information that is not relevant to the current investigation.
